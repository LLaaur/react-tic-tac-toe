Tic Tac Toe project with bot player using the minimax algorithm built with React.

Things I learned:

I. How to create a React app and initialize a local server for visualizing my project.

II. JSX syntax

III. What React Elements are and how to render them

IV. Components and props

IV. State

V. Event handling on elements

VI. Using keys (in arrays especially)

... and much more!


About The Minimax algorithm

From javaatpoint.com

- Mini-max algorithm is a recursive or backtracking algorithm which is used in decision-making and game theory. It provides an optimal move for the player assuming that opponent is also playing optimally.

- Mini-Max algorithm uses recursion to search through the game-tree.

- Min-Max algorithm is mostly used for game playing in AI. Such as Chess, Checkers, tic-tac-toe, go, and various tow-players game. This Algorithm computes the minimax decision for the current state.
